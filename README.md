# Secure-Network-For-An-Institution
This project contains a designed network for an institution with several subnets. This network is secured with the help of Cybersecurity techniques.

# Network 
- The proposed network design is a wired connection based network , which consists of 6 subnets mainly as Computer Science department, Principal room, server room, lab, etc. Where  each subnet is designed as per the requirements of the particular department.

- The network comprises of IP based switches that remain as the access point to LAN-based (Ethernet) as well as Wi-Fi-based connectivity.
  
- These switches provide SNMP support as well so that traffic monitoring becomes easy.
 
- The inter VLAN routing feature is supported on both IP base or SMI and IP services or EMI image Layer 3 switches.
 
- The IP Base feature set includes advanced quality of service (QoS), rate limiting, access control lists (ACLs), and basic static and Routing Information Protocol (RIP) functions.
